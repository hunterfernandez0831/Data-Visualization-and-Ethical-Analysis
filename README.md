# data-transformation-and-analysis-for-global-food-security-issues
I engaged in extensive data transformation and analysis in this project to understand global food security issues. The primary data sources included datasets on food waste, global hunger indices, and GDP from various sources such as CSV files and an API. The main steps involved loading and cleaning data, performing transformations, and then combining the datasets into a unified format for analysis.

**Key transformations included:**

Data Cleaning: Dropping irrelevant columns like 'Year' where it was unnecessary and handling missing values to ensure a complete dataset.

Data Merging: Combining datasets from different sources using SQL joins and pandas merging to view food security metrics comprehensively.

Data Analysis: Visualizing relationships and distributions using scatter plots and histograms to derive insights about food waste, hunger, and economic factors.

The integration of these datasets aimed to provide a holistic view of global food security, exploring how food waste relates to hunger indices and regional food service estimates.

**Summary of Ethical Implications**

Changes Made to the Data:
Cleaning: Removed redundant columns and handled missing values to enhance data quality.

Merging: Combined datasets from different sources to provide a more complete view.

Visualizations: Generated graphs to analyze trends and relationships.

**Legal and Regulatory Guidelines:**
Data Privacy: Adherence to privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) was essential, especially for sensitive datasets.

Data Sharing: Ensured proper attribution and compliance with data usage terms per the data sources' licenses.

**Risks Created Based on Transformations:**
Data Integrity: Transformations like merging and dropping columns could inadvertently lead to data loss or misinterpretation if not handled carefully.

Bias: The selection of data and transformations might introduce bias, affecting the accuracy of insights.

**Assumptions in Cleaning/Transforming Data:**
Assumptions: Assumed that the dropped columns were not essential for the analysis. I assumed consistency in data formats and accuracy in the merged datasets.

Data Sourced / Verified for Credibility:**
Sources: Used reputable sources like World Bank API and publicly available datasets. Verification involved cross-referencing data points and ensuring alignment with known standards.
Ethical Acquisition of Data:
Ethics: Data was acquired from legitimate sources, respecting licensing agreements and not using proprietary or confidential information.
Mitigation of Ethical Implications:
Transparency: Documented all data sources and transformations clearly to ensure transparency.
Validation: Cross-verified data accuracy and integrity to minimize risks of misinterpretation.
Compliance: Ensured compliance with legal and ethical data privacy and usage standards.
By addressing these ethical considerations, the project aimed to uphold high data integrity and respect for privacy standards, ensuring that the insights derived are reliable and responsibly handled.
